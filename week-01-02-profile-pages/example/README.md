> This page is **not responsive** (desktop-only) as it demonstrates basic web concepts only. Responsive layouts are critical to modern web development. Responsive means the site layout adapts across different devices (breakpoints), i.e. mobile, table, desktop. A good tutorial is [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design). **In general, design mobile-first.**
